# SQL Project MAGIST - A Data Science Project

This SQL code is a part of the WBS CODING SCHOOL Data Science Group Project, which is an ongoing weekly project with an expected completion date of October 26, 2023.

The project's objective is to address various business questions and assist the management department in making informed decisions regarding a potential partnership with an online product service company in Brazil, known as MAGIST. This decision holds significant importance as it aligns with the business's expansion strategy into new territories.

The project's database encompasses data related to MAGIST from September 2016 to October 2018. It is important to note that the dataset is comprehensive, yet it lacks data for the final two months, and no explanation for this data gap has been provided.

The focus of this SQL code centers on analyzing MAGIST's sales trends during the years 2017 and 2018.

## Installation
